key consdierations
0. Architecture consideration
- BM25 for retrieval because bert on all documents is impossibly costly
- BERT rerank because BM25 is not as good as ranking the documents
- More layers of BERT can be added for better ranking

1. rerank model choice

2. score consideration
- combination of BM25 and bert score with more weights on bert

2. batch processing on GPU

3. Truncation vs doc_stride when predicting

4. Number of outputs returned

5.
