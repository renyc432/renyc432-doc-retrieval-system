                  <td>BACKGROUND: A pandemic of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection broke out all over the world, however, epidemiological data and viral shedding in pediatric patients are limited. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, multi‐center study, and followed up with all children from the families with SARS‐CoV‐2 infected members in Zhejiang Province, China. All infections were confirmed by testing the SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA with RT‐PCR method, and epidemiological data between children and adults in the same families was compared. Effect of antiviral therapy was evaluated observationally and fecal viral excretion times among groups with different antiviral regiments were compared with Kaplan Meier plot. RESULTS: By February 29, 2020, 1298 cases from 883 families were confirmed with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and 314 of which were families with children. Incidence of infection in child close contacts was significantly lower than that in adult contacts (13.2% vs 21.2%). The mean age of 43 pediatric cases was 8.2 years and mean incubation period was 9.1 days. Forty (93.0%) were family clustering. Thirty‐three children had COVID‐19 (20 pneumonia) with mild symptoms and 10 were asymptomatic. Fecal SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA detection was positive in 91.4% (32/35) cases and some children had viral excretion time over 70 days. Viral clearance time was not different among the groups treated with different antiviral regiments. No subsequent infection was observed in family contacts of fecal‐viral‐excreting children. CONCLUSION: Children have lower susceptibility of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, longer incubation and fecal viral excretion time. Positive results of fecal SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA detection were not used as indication for hospitalization or quarantine. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</td>

                  <td>Publisher Summary Pathogenic microorganisms usually originate from an infected host or directly from the environment; however, only a small proportion of these microbes cause infection. This chapter discusses the pathogens that are transmitted through the environment such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Many human pathogens can be transmitted only by direct or close contact with an infected person or animal such as herpesvirus. Virus transmission by the airborne route may be both direct and indirect inhalation of infectious droplets or through contact with contaminated fomites. Water-borne diseases—such as yellow fever, dengue, filariasis, malaria, onchocerciasis, and sleeping sicknessare transmitted by insects that breed in water or live near water. The common bacterial pathogens transmitted through water include Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, Vibrio, Helicobacter, and Legionella. Opportunistic pathogens are also numerous in the environment, and the most important opportunistic pathogen is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Viruses are a leading cause of gastroenteritis and water-borne outbreaks may be caused by norovirus, hepatitis A virus, Coxsackie virus, echovirus, and adenoviruses. Respiratory diseases are also associated with a large number of viruses such as rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, and adenovirus. Generally, viral and protozoan pathogens survive longer in the environment than enteric bacterial pathogens.</td>

                  <td>Many old and “modern” cities have been built on terrain that was previously vegetated and part of biologically diverse ecosystems. This was often on productive farmland that was not protected from encroachment as municipalities expanded and opened pristine areas to development. The encroachment continues as rural citizens and their families are attracted to urban centers for the way of life they seemed to offer. This starts with employment possibilities, education for workers children, and family health services as manufacturing/industrial operations and large and small businesses that serviced them spurs economic development. Agricultural projects are located mainly away from population centers, be they major metropolises or smaller cities. They provide food security for urban citizens through “brought into markets” in-ground crops, bush crops, and tree crops they cultivate, and through animal husbandry (e.g., beef and dairy cattle, poultry, hogs, sheep). The last chapter described how manufacturing/industrial endeavors can present potential harm to the health of urban and rural citizens and to natural resource rich ecosystems that help sustain them, and how to find solutions to the problems. This chapter will discuss the problems that food production methods present, the threats they pose to urban populations that are generally distant from them, and possible solutions to such problems.</td>

                  <td>Abstract A review of the relevant foodborne viruses is presented. Published data from scientific journals as well as the data presented in official reports and published on the Internet were used for this review. In the review, information is given for the main foodborne viruses, implicated virus species, and food matrices involved, some history data are given, as well as modes of transmission, and sources of the virus presence in food. Results of surveys on the presence of viruses in different kind of foods commodities (fresh produces and shellfish) and in some cases connections to caused outbreaks are presented. Also, possible zoonotic infection and implicated viruses that could be transmitted through food are given. Human Norovirus followed by hepatitis A virus are the most common foodborne viruses, which are transmitted by food consumed raw, such as shellfish, fresh vegetables, and berry fruit. In developed countries, hepatitis E virus is increasingly being recognized as an emerging viral foodborne pathogen that includes zoonotic transmission via pork products. The existing knowledge gaps and the major future expectations in the detection and surveillance of foodborne viruses are mentioned.</td>
