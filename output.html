      <td>The ongoing global crisis due to Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an enormous socioeconomic burden. A novel coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) that evolved from a virus infecting bats is responsible for COVID-19, first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan. In the absence of any specific scientifically proven and clinically tested drug or vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus is wreaking havoc across the world, claiming more than 2,50,000 lives in less than 5 months, and posed a global health emergency. The scientific community is relentlessly working on the design and testing of vaccines and antiviral drugs against the novel coronavirus, several of which have reached advanced stages of testing and are undergoing clinical trials. Here we discuss the recent advances and developments in understanding the etiology and epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic, the factors influencing the disease transmission, and the countermeasures adopted to combat and stop further spread of the disease.</td>

      <td>COVID-19 has created an unprecedented level of research and innovation activity globally to bring out drug to control or cure the disease, and develop vaccine for long time prevention. A 'new/better normal' is emerging that is trying to push this time period for drug development and vaccine within a year and earlier than that from typical 8 to 10 years for drugs and 10 to 15 years for vaccine. This is happening due to multiple factors: strong policy push by different government that includes dedicated investment, speeding up regulation process, multiple agencies involvement, and multilateral bodies led by WHO trying to create a global platform, huge grants from private funding bodies, strategic linkages across the whole research and innovation value chain between firms, academic, research organisations and start-ups. The paper maps the research papers and ongoing clinical trials to provide an informed view of the current status of the research and drug development activity as seen through the lens of research papers and clinical trials. The intended goal of this study is to help the research community and policy makers to keep track of highly relevant research and drug development in COVID-19.</td>

      <td>The top priority of any nation is to lead the nation towards prosperity, progress, and economic growth, confronting several challenges and concerns arisen from global situations. The sudden outbreak of any disease defies the health care systems and economy of nations. COVID-19 is one of the viral diseases which broke out in Wuhan city of China in 2019. COVID-19 outbreak intermittently prevailed all over the world. It exposes the fragility of the established health care systems across the world in spite of comprising modern science and technology. Unfortunately, there is no chemotherapeutic agent in the regimen of antiviral drugs or no vaccine available to curb this infectious disease. As a consequence, this deadly infection has prevailed all over the world. The antiviral drugs used for viral diseases excluding COVID-19 infection are Ramdesvir, Favipiravir, and Ribavarin, and antimalarial agents (Chloroquine & Hydroxychloroquine) are being administered to the patients for redemption of this infection. Fortunately, these existing drugs have been found clinically active and are being used. In this review, we present the current scenario and status of epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, vaccine development for COVID-19, and its impact on the socio-economic structure.</td>

      <td>The COVID-19 pandemic is rising at an unprecedented rate. The surging number of deaths every day, global lockdown and travel restrictions have resulted in huge losses to society. The impact is massive and will leave a historical footprint. The Spanish Flu of 1918, which was the last pandemic that had a similar impact, was shadowed under the consequences of World War I. All the brilliance, strength and economies of countries worldwide are aimed at fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. The knowledge about coronavirus dynamics, its nature and epidemiology are expanding every day. The present review aims to summarize the structure, epidemiology, symptoms, statistical status of the disease status, intervention strategies and deliberates the lessons learnt during the pandemic. The intervention approaches, antiviral drug repurposing and vaccine trials are intensified now. Statistical interpretations of disease dynamics and their projections may help the decision-makers.</td>

      <td>COVID-19 has become the gravest global public health crisis since the Spanish Flu of 1918. Combination antiviral therapy with repurposed broad-spectrum antiviral agents holds a highly promising immediate treatment strategy, especially given uncertainties of vaccine efficacy and developmental timeline. Here, we describe a novel hypothetical approach: combining available broad-spectrum antiviral agents such as nucleoside analogs with potential inhibitors of NendoU, for example nsp15 RNA substrate mimetics. While only hypothesis-generating, this approach may constitute a ‘double-hit’ whereby two CoV-unique protein elements of the replicase–transcriptase complex are inhibited simultaneously; this may be an Achilles' heel and precipitate lethal mutagenesis in a coronavirus. It remains to be seen whether structurally optimized RNA substrate mimetics in combination with clinically approved and repurposed backbone antivirals can synergistically inhibit this endonuclease in vitro, thus fulfilling the ‘double-hit hypothesis’.</td>

      <td>The current pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is a global health emergency because of its highly contagious nature, the great number of patients requiring intensive care therapy, and the high fatality rate. In the absence of specific antiviral drugs, passive prophylaxis, or a vaccine, the treatment aim in these patients is to prevent the potent virus-induced inflammatory stimuli from leading to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has a severe prognosis. Here, the mechanism of action and the rationale for employing immunological strategies, which range from traditional chemically synthesized drugs, anti-cytokine antibodies, human immunoglobulin for intravenous use, to vaccines, are reviewed.</td>

      <td>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to sweep the world, causing infection of millions and death of hundreds of thousands. The respiratory disease that it caused, COVID-19 (stands for coronavirus disease in 2019), has similar clinical symptoms with other two CoV diseases, severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome (SARS and MERS), of which causative viruses are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively. These three CoVs resulting diseases also share many clinical symptoms with other respiratory diseases caused by influenza A viruses (IAVs). Since both CoVs and IAVs are general pathogens responsible for seasonal cold, in the next few months, during the changing of seasons, clinicians and public heath may have to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other kinds of viral pneumonia. This is a discussion and comparison of the virus structures, transmission characteristics, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, pathological changes, treatment and prevention of the two kinds of viruses, CoVs and IAVs. It hopes to provide information for practitioners in the medical field during the epidemic season.</td>

      <td>The world has faced an unprecedented challenge when coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged as a pandemic. Millions of people have contracted the virus and a significant number of them lost their lives, resulting in a tremendous social and economic shock across the globe. Amid the growing burden of the pandemic, there are parallel emergencies that need to be simultaneously tackled: the proliferation of fake medicines, fake news and medication misinformation surrounding COVID-19. Pharmacists are key health professionals with the required skills and training to contribute to the fight against these emergencies. Primarily, they can be a relevant source of accurate and reliable information to the public or other fellow health professionals thereby reducing the spread of COVID-19 medication misinformation. This can be achieved by providing accurate and reliable information based on recommendations given by relevant health authorities and professional associations to make sure the community understand the importance of the message and thus minimise the detrimental consequences of the pandemic. This commentary aims to summarise the existing literature in relation to the promising treatments currently under trial, the perils of falsified medications and medicine-related information and the role of pharmacists in taking a leading role in combating these parallel global emergencies.</td>
